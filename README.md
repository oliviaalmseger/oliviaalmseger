# Hello There! 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @OliviaAlmseger
- 🌱 I'm currently studying to become a Frontend Developer
- 🌟 Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy reading books and baking sourdough bread
- 💡 Before diving into frontend development, I worked as a speech and language pathologist (SLP) specializing in swallowing disorders and acquired speech and language difficulties following brain injuries. Through this work, I discovered the importance of accessibility and adaptations, especially through assistive technologies — which eventually inspired me to pursue a career in tech and frontend development.
